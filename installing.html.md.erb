###<a id='apps'></a> Ingest Log Data from Applications

To configure ISS Knowtify Search Analytics to ingest log data from applications, perform the following steps:

1. [Download](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) and install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information, see the [Installing the cf CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) topic.

1. Create a user-provided service instance, replacing SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME with the name of the instance, LOGSTASH-IP with your Logstash server IP address, and LOGSTASH-PORT with your Logstash server port number:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf cups SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -l syslog://LOGSTASH-IP:LOGSTASH-PORT</pre>

1. List the applications in your space:
	<pre class='terminal'>
	$ cf apps  
	Getting apps in org example / space development as admin...
	OK
	name                requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
	spring-music        started           1/1         1G       1G     spring-music.example.com 
	</pre>

1. Bind the service instance to the application you want to ingest logs from:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME</pre>

	After binding the service instance, log data from the application begins to flow into the ISS Knowtify Search Analytics dashboard. 

	<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> If log data from the application does not appear in the ISS Knowtify Search Analytics dashboard, restage the app with <code>cf restage APP-NAME</code> or repush the app with <code>cf push APP-NAME</code>.</p>
